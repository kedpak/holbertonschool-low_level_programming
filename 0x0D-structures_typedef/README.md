# Structs in C

## Sypnosis
This project will be going over structs, how structs are declared, and how to utilize them in a program. 

## Description of structs
A struct is a complex data type declaration which defines a group of listed variables that are placed in a \
single name. It is placed under a single block of memory, which can be accessed by a pointer or the struct declared \
name which returns the corresponding address.
