# Binaray Trees
## Description
A tree is reprsented with nodes connected with linkes to other nodes. Binary trees are primarily used for data storages purposes. In a binary tree, each node has a maximum of two chidren. Typicaly, the right child and the left child. Binary trees are effecient for searching through an ordered array, or for insertion/deletion. 

### Terms
* Path - refers to sequence of nodes along edges of tree
* Root - node at the top of the tree
* Parent - A node that is not root in which had nodes connecting downward
* Child- A node that is not the root in which has a connection upward
* Leaf - A node that does not have a child node
* SubTree - descendants of a node
* Visiting- checking value of node when in control of node
* Traversing - passing through nodes in a certain order
* Levels - Represents the generation of node. Root is at level 0, childe of root is level 1 etc.
* Keys - values of the node

### Basic Operations
* Insert - inserts an element into the tree or creates new tree if tree doesn't already exist
* Search - search for an element inside the tree
* Preorder Traversal
* Inorder Traversal
* Postorder Traversal
