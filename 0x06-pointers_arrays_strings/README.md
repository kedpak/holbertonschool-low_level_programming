# Double Pointers and Muti-dimensional Arrays in C

## Synopsis
This project utilizes double pointers and multi-dimenstional arrays with the C language

## Description
A double pointer is a pointer to a pointer. It is declared just like a regular pointer except it will possess an extra '*' before the variable name. 

A multi-deminsional array is simply when one or more arrays are inside of an array. A two-dimensional array, is a type of multi-dimensional array where an array contains an array with more than one array inside of it. 

## Examples
'char **doub_pointer'
Code declares a double pointer

'int array[3][3] = { {2,3,4}, {43,3,0}, {4,11,34} };'
Code declares a 3x3 two-dimensional array
