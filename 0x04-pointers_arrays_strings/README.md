# Pointers and Arrays in C
## Synopsis
This project utilizes pointers and arrays

## Description
Pointers and arrays are related yet different concepts. And array in C is a type of data structure that stores data of the same data type in sequence. Arrays can be declared through a variable, and inside can be stored multiple elements of the same data type. Arrays can vary in size, and typically the size of the array is declared at declaration. 

Pointers are variables with the value of the address of another variable. Pointers are declared with an '*', and are declared just like any other variable. 

## Examples

'char string[10] = "hey watsup";'
The code here displays an array of strings with the size of 10 being declared.

'char *pointer'
'pointer = malloc(sizeof(char) * 1);'
The code displays a pointer being declared and defined. This particular pointer points the memory address of a dynamically allocated space of memory.
