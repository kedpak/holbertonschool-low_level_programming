#Doubly Linked Lists in C
## Synoposis
This project goes over doubly linked lists in the C programming language
## Description
Doubly linked lists are linked data structures that contain linked data and nodes. The nodes contain two fields called links. These links are pointers to the node that the link will traverse to in a sequence. Therefore, one link is for traversing to the next node, while the other is for traversing to the previous node. 
## Examples
'struct doublyLinkedList {
prev // pointer to previous node
next // pointer to next node
data // reference to data inside node
}
