# Sorting Algorithms and Big 0 Notation

## Synopsis
Practice problems for sorting algorithms in C.

This project utilizes four different sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, selection, quick sort) and their Big 0 runtimes.

## Description
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that sorts elements of a list to a speicific type of order. 

Big-O represents an equation that returns the runtime of an algorithm.
