# Static Libraries in C
## Synopsis
This project will go over static libraries, how they are used, and why they are important.
## Description
A static library is a file which holds object files, that can be utilized during the linking phase of compilation. The primary advantage of libraries in C is to allow users to link programs without having to recompile them. Therefore, time is saved since all object files are placed into a singular file(the library). A C library ends with a “.a” and is normally indexed. As a result, it is easier to find symbols such as functions and variables inside of them. It is much faster to link a program when the object files are contained inside one organized file, as opposed to multiple files. This is why libraries are vital.
