# Pointers and Arrays in C
## Synopsis
This project utilizes pointers and arrays

## Description
Pointers and arrays are related	yet different concepts.	And array in C is a type of data structu\
re that	 stores data of the same    data type in sequence. Arrays can be declared through a	variable\
, and inside can be stored multiple elements of	 the same data type. Arrays can vary in size, and\
 typically the size of the array is declared at	 declaration.

Pointers are variables with the	 value of the address of	another	variable. Pointers are declared	\
with an	 '*', and are declared just like  any other variable.

## Examples

'char string[10] = "hey	watsup";'
The code here displays an array	of strings with	the size of 10 being declared.

'char *pointer'
'pointer = malloc(sizeof(char) * 1);'
The code displays a pointer being declared and defined.	This particular	pointer	points the memor\
y address of a dynamically allocated space of memory.
